## What is HelenaWeather?
`HelenaWeather` is a Framework that uses the OpenWeatherMap-Api to fetch weather data for a specific place at a specific point in time (in the future). The Framework is purly written in Swift.

## How can I use HelenaWeather?
Instanciate `HelenaWeather`, pass your `OpenWeatherMap-API_KEY` and call `requestWeather()` on your HelenaWeather-Instance.

You can also use the `HelenaWeatherView` (SwiftUI) for experimenting.
